  <h1>This Page Written by her Manager: Michael Widener II<br>Aeleth's Real Name is: Natalee Trevilo.</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the official "explainer page" (landing page and introduction page combined) for Aeleth! She's our new recording artist and her voice is simply amazing. We discovered Aeleth taking care of others in her day-job, and to our amazement, she had already won over the entire office. There were days when I was in the office and I could not distinguish between her voice and what was playing on the office's ceiling speakers! Then one time, the staff went and started fooling around with the sound, turning it down, then back up, until Miss Aeleth, agreed to sing them a whole song without any radio, not background noise, and with the door closed so I could hear what they already knew. I heard it! I thought I had been dreaming that voice! I kept thinking that office had a hidden Lucasfilm THX processor in the closet! It wasn't! It was her! And she agreed to, and is even happy, to be our first recording artist! Head over to our page and watch what happens when you hear it! You won't hear a high definition version of it because then it's downloadable and someone will take it. You'll hear a "down-rez'ed version" (the nickname "rez" stands for "resolution" which is the quality of a digital thing. Be it an image or audio its "resolution" is how good it will sound and it's a technical term) but you'll get the picture anyway! We prmoise!
